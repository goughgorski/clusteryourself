1. create project branch on local machine

git checkout -b [project_branch_name]

2. prepare to write models, ensemble, and model transforms to database

check for database changes that will need to be made (new enum values, new columns, etc.)

3. modify Par-a-box R environment scripts, if necessary to load new model(s)

Rserv.conf, load_active_models.R, load_model_transforms.R

4. test classifier function in local R environment

set up the environment by manually running Rserv.conf script line by line (exclude 'eval' command at the beginning of each line)

5. deploy project branch to heroku app

6. merge project branch to master

classifier function to /functions folder, model script to /scripts folder, any changes to existing scripts (Rserv.conf, etc.)
