GCP management

All products/services (data storage, databases, AI tools) live within a project.

	- USF Project name: functionally conceptual

Data storage: accessed on Storage tab on console, follows bucket/folder/file(s) structure

	- USF files: baseline-assumption/don-econ/[course, ie, econ_621]/[file name]

Database: accessed on SQL tab on console, follows instance/database structure
* instance has public IP address and connection name
* connection to the instance connects to all databases

	- USF database: don-econ

Connecting to database
1. Find your public IP address: 'get my IP' google query will return it

2. In SQL instance, go to Connections tab and add that IP address as an authorized network. That will allow connections from that IP address.

3. In external app (eg, dBeaver), create a user account with user name and password
* CREATE USER [user name] WITH PASSWORD '[password]'
* DO NOT CREATE NEW USER IN GCP CONSOLE - default creates superuser

4. Grant new user schema usage and table privileges
* GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA [schema] TO [user name]
* GRANT [privilege, eg, SELECT] ON TABLE [table] TO [user name]

5. Enter connection settings for external connection (dBeaver, RStudio, etc.)
* Host: instance's public IP address
* Database: database name (not including instance name)
* Port: 5432
* User: user name
* Password: password

	- USF connection settings:
	* Host: 35.230.7.96
	* Database: don-econ
	* Port: 5432
	* User: usfstudent
	* Password: dons

Adding data to database
1. Create empty data table column structure in database, based on the existing data

2. Strip the data of column headers

3. Go to storage and upload data to appropriate bucket/folder from local

4. Go to instance and import; choose destination database and table

5. Refresh data table in external app to make sure data is there

6. Add privileges for data table
* GRANT [privilege, eg, SELECT] ON TABLE [table] TO [user name]
